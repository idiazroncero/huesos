# HUESOS
by [idiaz.roncero](http://idiazroncero.com)

__Huesos__ is idiaz.roncero's front-end starterkit. It provides a basic SCSS-JS osamenta by combining some preferred and battle-tested tools. 

__Huesos__ shamelessly grabs pieces of code from these amazing projects:

## Foundation 6

Normalization, basic components, mixins, helpers && UI. In a word: everything but the grid and tipography.

## Ritmo

This is a proud Compass' vertical rhythm heir. We borrow their vertical rhythm mixins && functions. 

## Susy

Presentations aren't needed here. No grid system will *ever* beat Susy. No one. No f*****g way.

(Well, CSS grid will, but that's something completely different, that's an official CSS spec. We talkin' about SCSS tools here)



BTW, in spanish 'huesos' means __bones__ and 'osamenta' is a fancy way to say __skeleton__.

Shake your osamenta.
