# HUESOS
#### Shake your osamenta
v0.0.3 | By [idiaz.roncero](http://idiazroncero.com)

__Huesos__ is idiaz.roncero's front-end starterkit. It provides a basic SCSS-JS osamenta by combining some preferred and battle-tested tools.

## Toolkit

__Huesos__ shamelessly grabs pieces of code from these amazing projects:

### UIKit + Concise.css

Normalization, basic components, mixins, helpers && UI.

### Ritmo

This is a proud Compass' vertical rhythm heir. We borrow their vertical rhythm mixins && functions. 

### Susy

Presentations aren't needed here. No grid system will *ever* beat Susy. No one. No f*****g way.
(Well, CSS grid will, but that's something completely different, that's an official CSS spec. We talkin' about SCSS tools here)


## Build process

__Huesos__ is built upon yarn/npm, with webpack 2 as the bundling tool (also dev server and other amenities). 

### NPM Scripts

For further reference, see `package.json`

`npm run build` runs webpack in production mode: minified assets, export CSS, no dev server.

BTW, in spanish 'huesos' means *bones* and 'osamenta' is a fancy way to say *skeleton*.
