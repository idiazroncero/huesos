/*
Kill Link

Completely disables the visual appearance of a link. It defaults to primary text color.

Use carefully and scope only to the very elements you want to style. Unwanted overrides are easy to get.

Markup:
<section class="kill-link">
	<p>The <a href="#">links</a> within this text are <a href="#">completely equal to normal text</a></p>
</section>
