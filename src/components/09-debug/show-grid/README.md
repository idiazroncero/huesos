# The grid

Setting `$show-grid` to true will show a grid both behind the `<body>` element and behind every `<h1-h6>` and `<p>` elements using ritmo units in order to measure vertical rhythm.

Since we don't follow vertical rhythm as mandatory (i.e image heights, margins) it's normal than elements won't stick to the body grid.

A helper class `.show-grid` is also included.
