Setting `$show-grid` to true will show a grid both behind the `<body>`. Note that image, video and iframe's height may throw vertical rhythm away.

A helper class `.show-grid` is also included. This class can be applied to any container to show the grid.

The grid includes "half steps" (1/2 of the vertical rhythm) to help debugging uneven units (i.e. `ritmo(5)`).
