# Alerts

Boxes with background-colors to draw the user's attention towards specific messages.

Any alert is automatically set as a `.text` to prevent paragraphs for setting an extra space.

It is considered good practice to use `.minititle` for headings inside the alert box.

- .alert--success     - Sets the color to indicate a positive action or message
- .alert--warning     - Sets the color to indicate a warning
- .alert--error       - Sets the color to indicate a negative action or message
