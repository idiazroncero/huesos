Uploading files requires a little bit of CSS (and, opotionally, JS).

With the only-css solution, the label is styled as a button and the `input` is shown on the left. This is great and works, but is limited on its display.

With `[data-file-input]` enabled on the wrapper, you get a button-like input that will inform the user on the number of files that are uploaded, and the name of the file when it's only one.
