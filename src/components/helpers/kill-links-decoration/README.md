Helper class that kills all links' decoration on a given block.

Use carefully and scope only to the very elements you want to style. Unwanted overrides are easy to get.

__How's this different from the mixin?__ This class is helper devised to quickly disable all links' decoration within a container. It is applied at a container-level and will apply to _every_ link, while the mixin is applied individually.
