Completely disables the visual appearance of __links within a container__. It defaults to primary text color.

Use carefully and scope only to the very elements you want to style. Unwanted overrides are easy to get.

__How's this different from the mixin?__ This class is helper devised to quickly disable all links within a container. It is applied at a container-level and will apply to _every_ link, while the mixin is applied individually.
