# Images and figures

Images are responsive by default.

The variable `$figcaption-font-size` defines the sizing of image captions, while the `$figcaption-align` variable sets a global alignment.

## Alignment tricks

In order to align the whole block while keeping the textalignment of the figcaption defined on `$figcaption-align`, you need to wrap the entire `<figure>` on an html block element containing the `.right`, `.left` or `.center` class.
