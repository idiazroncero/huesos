/*
Links

All links are formatted throught `set-link()` mixin.

The `.link-strategy` is honored but you can override it anytime by using helper classes.

Markup:
<a href="#" class="myclass {{modifier_class}}">This is a link! Here! Click! If smart, gujihqpol</a>

.link--inactive         	- Makes link appear as normal text but retain functionality
.disabled         			- The helper class dims the link and deletes visual feedback
.link-strategy-underline	- Sets a link as if `$link-strategy` was set to 'underline'
.link-strategy-border		- Sets a link as if `$link-strategy` was set to 'border'
.link-strategy-smart		- Sets a link as if `$link-strategy` was set to 'smart'
.link-strategy-mark			- Sets a link as if `$link-strategy` was set to 'mark'
.link-inverted				- Uses the inverted colors for this link. Normally used against a background.
