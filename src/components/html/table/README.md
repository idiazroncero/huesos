By default, we enforte tables to take 100% of the available width and distribute cell spacing evenly.

You can add a `.table` wrapper that ensures that a basic responsive solution (using overflow-x) is set.

Borders are collapsed by default and `<caption>` receives a `.minititle` styling.

You can tweak the basic appearance using `$table-border-width`, `$table-border-color`, `$table-padding` and `$table-th-align`
