Sets a horizontal navigation that indicates the user the "path" or hierarchy followed until the current page.

You can set the UNICODE element that marks the hierarchy by setting `$breadcrumb-arrow`.

`$breadcrumb-kill-links` will delete kill decoration (wich is the default behavior) while `$breadcrumb-font-size` allows you to set a font size.
