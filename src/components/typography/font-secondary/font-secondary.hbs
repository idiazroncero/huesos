<p class="font-secondary">This paragraph has been set to use the secondary font.
It could otherwise have used a regular CSS selector with <code>@extend %font-secondary</code>
to achieve the same effect. <strong>Some elements like the bold text use specific values for the secondary font.</strong></p>
