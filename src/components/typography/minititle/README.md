The (opinionated) concept of "minititle" makes reference to a small heading, normally used for sectioning. [Read more on the `minititle()` mixin docs](/docs/mixins/typography/minititle).

The helper `.minititle` class applies the mixin defaults: reduces the text size and then augments its visual weight by using a combination of a bold weight, an uppercase text-transform and a greater letter-spacing.

If you need to tweak the values, use the `minititle()` mixin instead.
