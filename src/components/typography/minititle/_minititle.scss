Minititle

The concept of "minititle" makes reference to a small heading, normally used for sectioning.

It is an opinionated design that reduces the text size and then augments its visual weight by using a combination of a bold weight, an uppercase text-transform and a greater letter-spacing.

Markup:
<section>
	<p class="minititle">This is the minititle of this section</p>
	<p>A normal text. As we said before, the minititle gives visual weight while using a small font-size</p>
</section>
<section class="card" style="width:250px">
	<h3 class="minititle">An h3 reduced!</h3>
	<p>You can use your <em>minititle</em> on <code>heading</code> elements and maintain the semantics while reducing the font-size</p>
</section>
