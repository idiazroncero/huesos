Tipographic quotes can be explicitly defined using the variable `$quotes`

Read the [quotes reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/quotes) to learn about the values taken by this property and how to declare quote pairings.

For quick reference, you can find the following quote characters and pairings on `_config.scss`:

```scss
// Here are some common quotes: “ ” ‘ ’ ‛ ‟ ‚ „ ' " ‹ › « »
// Latin quotes (spanish, french): "«" "»" "“" "”"
// English quotes: "“" "”" "‘" "’"
```
