# Text wrapper

Paragraph items wrapped on any element marked as `.text-wrapper` will have its last `p` child set marginless.

They also feature extra spacing on headings, articles and sections.

Use this class as a quick way for setting some typographic default behaviors on big chunks of formatted text (i.e, the body of a blog post or article, etc).
