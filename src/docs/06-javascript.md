### Accordion

Use `[data-accordion]` on a wrapper element around some `details` to set an accordion-like behavior using JS. The opening of an element should close the rest.

### File uploader

A really simple and straightforward file input is provided.

With `[data-file-input]` enabled on the wrapper, you get a button-like input that will inform the user on the number of files that are uploaded, and the name of the file when it's only one.
