### Why don't you use lobotomized owl?

Even if we agree that [lobotomized owl](https://css-tricks.com/lobotomized-owls/) is one of the most ingenious techniques we've seen for a while, we want also to stick to the __only margin-bottoms__ rule... and that is opposite to the way the lobotomized owl works.

So... no global lobotomized owls, for the time being. But... you can still use `.owl` helpers to apply it at a block-level!

### Your <ul\> and <ol\> are wrong!

Nope, they're right. It's the whole internet who's wrong. Read _hanging punctuation_ section on [this article](https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2018/10/15/rhythm-in-web-typography/) to see why.

Unconvinced? Set `$list-padding` to other than `0` and be as happily wrong as 90% of the web.
